[Aligulac](www.aligulac.com) is a wonderful website that algorithmically ranks professional StarCraft II players. To do so, they keep track of almost every professional StarCraft II match played and they make this data, along with data about players, available for download [here](www.aligulac.com/about/db/). I downloaded this data and analyzed it. This repository contains my code for doing the analysis. You can see the results by running the code yourself or by seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/6rzdb1/starcraft_ii_aligulac_data_analysis/).
